An ECR image may be referenced and tagged by more than one ECR Repository. To best represent this, we've created an
`ECRRepositoryImage` node as a layer of indirection between the repo and the image.

More concretely explained, we run
[`ecr.list_images()`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/APIReference/API_ImageIdentifier.html), and then
store the image tag on an `ECRRepositoryImage` node and the image digest hash on a separate `ECRImage` node.

This way, more than one `ECRRepositoryImage` can reference/be connected to the same `ECRImage`.

| Field | Description |

### Relationships

- AWS API Gateway REST APIs are resources in an AWS Account.

        ```
        (AWSAccount)-[RESOURCE]->(APIGatewayRestAPI)
        ```

- AWS API Gateway REST APIs may be associated with an API Gateway Stage.

        ```
        (APIGatewayRestAPI)-[ASSOCIATED_WITH]->(APIGatewayStage)
        ```

- AWS API Gateway REST APIs may also have API Gateway Resource resources.

        ```
        (APIGatewayRestAPI)-[RESOURCE]->(APIGatewayResource)
        ```
